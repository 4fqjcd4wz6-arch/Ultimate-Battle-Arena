# Assets folder

Place here images, icons and audio assets for the game. Recommended filenames used by index.html:

- assets/favicon.svg  (favicon displayed in browser tabs)
- assets/sounds/click.mp3  (short click / UI sound)
- assets/sounds/dice.mp3
- assets/sounds/attack.mp3

Guidance:
- Prefer small and optimized images (webp/png) and short OGG/MP3 files for sounds.
- Reference assets from index.html with absolute paths: /assets/your-file.ext

To add actual image or audio files, upload binary files to the assets/ directory (via git push or GitHub web UI).
